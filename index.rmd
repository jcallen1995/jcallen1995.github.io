# Hi, I'm Jason Allen

<center>
I am a student at University of California Santa Barbara currently switching to the Geography major. I have worked on a number of projects at university including the [NASA Big Idea Challenge 2021](http://bigidea.nianet.org/2021-challenge/) recently where I help with research and graphics.

This website will be a showcase of my work with geospatial analysis over the course of my time at UCSB.
