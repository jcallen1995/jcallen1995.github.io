<br>

<center>
I am a GIS designer with experience using ESRI software and R code to analyze data and create maps. I worked at <br>
[Sonoma County GIS](https://gis-sonomacounty.hub.arcgis.com/) as an intern for a year and a half where I polished my GIS skills.

I was lucky enough to get an internship at Sonoma County GIS which allowed me to experience what working as a GIS technician was like at a professional level. I was also able to learn a lot about the interaction between us and our clients by sitting in on important meetings.
