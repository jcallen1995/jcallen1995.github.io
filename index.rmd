# Hi, I'm Jason Allen
</center>

<center>
I am a GIS designer with experience using ESRI software and R code to analyze data and create maps. I worked at [Sonoma County GIS](https://gis-sonomacounty.hub.arcgis.com/) as an intern for a year and a half where I polished my GIS skills.

This website will be a showcase of my work with geospatial analysis and GIS work over the last 2 years.
